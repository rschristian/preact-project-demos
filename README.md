# Preact Demos for various types of applications

The goal for this repo is to provide some examples of how you might build apps in an approachable "Preact way". This is not necessarily a set of best practices or a prescribed way to build apps, nor will they be hyper-optimized, but hopefully it serves as a source of inspiration for how you might build similar apps. As such, we'll tend to take an idea, like a blog, and show a couple variations of it to represent some of the variations you might need in the real world.

How you build your apps to support your needs might differ considerably from these examples, but that's okay! You cannot approach web-dev with a one-size-fits-all mentality, there is no such thing as a "Jack of all trades" here. If you don't cater your tooling and your methods to the specific needs of the project, you're going to deliver sub-optimal results to your users.

Will add to this over time, and might migrate over to the Preact org too.
